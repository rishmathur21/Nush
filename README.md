# Nush

Nush is a Unix shell like 'bash' that I wrote for my CS3650: Computer Systems Class in Spring 2019.

This shell supports basic operations such as 
- redirecting input and output ( < , > )
- pipe ( | )
- background processes ( & )
- logical 'and' ( && )
- logical 'or' ( || )
- doing left and then right operations ( ; )

To run this program, run ```make``` then run the binary.
